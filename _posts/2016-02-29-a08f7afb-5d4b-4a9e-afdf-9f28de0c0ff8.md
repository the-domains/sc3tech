The railway sector has many of the issues common to others, and then it's own: most industries seek to reduce costs, improve reliability and performance - but few are under the same expectations and political pressures. The airline industry has the same requirements, yet newspapers do not treat every delayed plane as sign of an industry in decline; shipping of large quantities of goods by road is less efficient and has a larger environmental impact than the cleaner types of rail, yet politicians rarely mention it as an approach for meeting greenhouse targets.

In addition, railways are expensive: the capital investments required for rolling stock, tracks and signalling / control systems are all significant. Using new technology to increase the reliability, reduce maintenance costs and improve the performance of existing assets is a key way in which such investments can be balanced with the need to maintain existing services. A longer service life for existing assets means more time to make a business case of new investment and also to allow newer, greener and more efficient options to mature.

Technologies such as lower power wide area networks can be used to install sensors and feedback systems in existing assets, without requiring large scale reconditioning or refurbishment; data collection from older embedded control systems can be supplemented with newer sensors and data wrangling systems used to provide both operational and strategic planning information. The "Internet of Things" hype often overstates things and minimises inherent risks, as is not uncommon for media coverage of stories to cover areas where the writers do not have first-hand knowledge: it does, however, suggest some possibilities.

Visualisation systems can be extended to include analytics: predictive modelling and machine learning can use all available data to provide "early warnings" and optimise maintenance planning, with variable behaviour across a set of assets used to identify outliers. As a starting point in exploring such opportunities, control charts can be used to monitor performance, trend lines can help prioritise maintenance and scheduling, and a range of other relatively small steps can be taken without any major changes in organisation or major investments in equipment or systems.

Different areas of the rail industry have different requirements and also different applications for data, analytics and related areas: 

* [Passenger Services][0]
* [Freight Services][1]
* [Service and Maintenance Vehicles][2]

It should be noted that many of the differences that seem to exist between these actually reflect different perspectives on very similar data.
