# Maintenance Operations

The day-to-day operations of any maintenance facility generate a significant amount of data, and while experience suggests much of this is recorded, there is an element of loss. For the data that are recorded, this is often on paper, or in tools such as Microsoft Excel, rather than in a database that allows for comparisons, queries and reports. In addition, in some cases measurements are obtained from automated systems that can then be used to "feed" such a database, and integrate that data with any that can be input manually: in one notable case, a maintenance procedure reportedly included an automated measurement that was then handwritten on a paper form that was later typed into a spreadsheet.

One example of such processes is the management of tires/wheels. The measurements can be recorded into a database and used to prioritise maintenance tasks: there are known thresholds at which intervention required, and "watermarks" can be applied to show when a given component requires attention, or when it is within a 'safe zone'. The combination of measured wear and distance travelled can be used to confirm maintenance schedules based on anticipated patterns: at that point it becomes possible to change the order of vehicles or potentially extend a schedule to make better use of resources and keep vehicles in service for the maximum amount of time. In addition, where regulatory regimes have defined points at which action is required (such as if a flat exceeds a certain length), this type of system can be used to ensure compliance.

The (edited) screenshot above shows measurement data with forecast: if the equipment used can export both measurements and vehicle / wheel identification information, the process can be automated. Variations or outliers can be identified, tasks prioritised, and work planned to enable a movement from scheduled to condition-based maintenance.
