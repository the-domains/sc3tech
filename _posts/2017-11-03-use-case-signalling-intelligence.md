# Signalling Intelligence

There are different signalling and control systems available on the market, and many come with proprietary software for analysis and decoding of the messages sent between the components of the system - the vehicles, trackside assets, station controllers, platform edge doors where used, and so on. There are, however, other possibilities inherent in the message traffic: if a message can be decoded as far as type, and the sending and receiving elements identified, then that information can be used _as a separate resource_ from the operational control network.

This creates several opportunities and also it can help with one of the biggest obstacles to processing signalling data: the isolation and separation of the signalling and control network from other parts of the IT infrastructure. If archived signalling data are kept, and a copy of that archive made available, a separate environment can be used to process that. Using even limited decoding, basic information can be obtained. For example, from patterns of message traffic, one can identify frequency of message retransmission (a proxy for message loss) and then use that to identify trends both in vehicle behaviour, trackside problems, and other similar areas. With more detailed decoding, it is possible to identify areas for optimisation such as time intervals between control messages, responses and action confirmations: with, for example, integrated control of doors at the platform edge, the intervals command messages and responses can be used to inform a project to address dwell time optimisation.

Using other sensors, it's also possible to analyse performance in terms of passenger movement.

While this example uses generated data, passenger movements - whether on and off vehicles, within buildings (such as bus stations or airports) or even within larger vehicles such as ferries - can be obtained from sensors or extracted from video coverage. 

Whether with signalling data or video coverage, if archive data kept then it can be processed to extract patterns and trends. With signalling data, such trends can be used to facilitate preventative maintenance; with passenger flow information, that data can be used to help with timetable planning, with building design or refurbishment planning, and so on. Using cloud computing services, this processing can be done at a far lower cost than is typically possible using internal systems, and can even be done at quiet times to take advantage of dynamic pricing where that is offered: alternatively, a year of data can potentially be processed in hours, depending on the preferred price-performance balance.
