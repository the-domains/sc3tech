  Freight operators have the same considerations as other transport companies,
  such as scheduling and route planning, but also have some different concerns:
  for example, in many cases, the items being moved are time sensitive (or
  possibly perishable), so while delays are perhaps seen as less pressing than
  with passenger trains, they are still important. In addition, customers &
  shippers may want routine location or timing information, and also overall
  performance and service level reporting: they may want remote telemetry that
  can provide alerts if parameters exceed thresholds, and look to the vehicle
  operator to provide the connectivity. Where there are multiple operators and
  open access, that connectivity may well be provided by the infrastructure
  manager acting as a service provider: depending on commercial arrangements,
  that could be data to the operator, or directly to the shippers.
