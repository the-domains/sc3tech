# Service and Maintenance Vehicles

The often-overlooked but necessary part of a transport operation, the availability of service and maintenance vehicles is often critical. To differing extents, such vehicles often have the same signalling interfaces (or a subset) and therefore can be used to help collect performance data from those systems. 

In addition, fitting sensors and diagnostics to the engineering fleet can provide a useful source of track maintenance data, so that each time one of the vehicles uses a section of the railway it is also performing a set of survey and measurement tasks. This can be as simple as recording data from accelerometers to measure track characteristics or as complex as real-time CCTV interpretation while the vehicle moves along track sections.
