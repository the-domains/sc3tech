# New Projects: Embedding Analytics

There are few opportunities for genuinely 'greenfield' (or even 'brownfield') projects in transport, but when they arise it is clearly possible to implement analytics and related features (such as sensors) during the initial phases. At the design phase, the desirability and feasibility of collecting selected parameters can be evaluated (and if necessary, research effort applied), during construction works sensors can be embedded, data collection can be specified in the procurement process for vehicles, and so on. In addition, approaches such as cloud computing can be used to reduce costs at early stages, and possibly adopted for long term use - removing the capital cost of data centre capacity for those processes, or at least providing a way for technologies and systems to be proven before any such investments are made.

The integration of such systems "day one" provides an enormous opportunity for reducing the lifetime cost of a transport system, and in ways that may not be immediately apparent. For example, in the rail sector, where open access means services are run over a common infrastructure, the benefits to the infrastructure manager are not just the direct impact of measuring their own performance, but also the potential to provide additional services to operators - and also to measure those operators' own assets (so that, for example, freight traffic can be monitored to ensure it is within contract specifications or additional charges levied). Maintenance data from monitoring the track can also help with testing signalling assets, and also the introduction of new vehicles, especially when those vehicles are of a new type.

For "mega projects" covering regions or countries, these approaches can also help with project integration: if a vehicle is tested in one area, and the characteristics and performance of the infrastructure is known in that area, then the analytics data can provide greater confidence that it will be suitable across the system. New systems or technologies can be tested in one region or at one facility, with confidence that the testing environment is representative of the overall network. If the cloud computing approach is adopted at this phase, a significant amount of modelling and analysis can be done before and during service introduction with a far lower capital investment than would otherwise be the case: vast amounts of data can be processed at a much lower cost than would be possible to do internally in a cost-effective manner. Techniques used in other sectors, such as the use of spot pricing for computing resources, can cut those costs even further: in addition, multiple types of tool can be used, different software tested, options for deployment and operations can be trialled, all with little or no capital investment compared with "traditional" IT. An additional benefit of this approach is that it facilitates distributed teams: this can lower costs not just within the project but also by supporting the effective use of third party contractors such as research teams, modelling specialists, subject matter experts at key suppliers, and so on.

The flexibility provided by embedding these tools at the design phase is clear: while cost reductions are important (and can be significant), the increase in flexibility and potential improvements in project delivery are possibly even greater arguments in favour of early stage adoption.
