Hopefully, this site has given some idea of what is possible using analytics tools with current data and relatively simple sensors, without requiring significant new investments in rolling stock or signalling system upgrades, or in servers and data centre equipment. There are several areas where SC3 Technologies can help with developing and implementing such systems, from initial study and concept design, to prototype development (on- board and wayside equipment, cloud services or on-premises analytics solutions) to assisting with a full-scale adoption programme.

The starting point for most such projects is an initial study and concept design, from a first "what if we could .... " to a first phase plan: alternatively, we can conduct a review of available data sources or specific areas of interest to determine a suitable approach.
