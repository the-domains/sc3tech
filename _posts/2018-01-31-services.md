This site has presents some ideas of what is possible using analytics tools with current data and relatively simple sensors, without requiring significant new investments in vehicles or control/signalling system upgrades, or in servers and data centre equipment. There are several areas where SC3 Technologies can help with developing and implementing such systems, from initial study and concept design, to prototype development (on- board and wayside equipment, cloud services or on-premises analytics solutions) to assisting with a full-scale adoption programme.

All of the visualisations within this site have been prepared by SC3 Technologies, based on genuine data (with some details changed, of course): several different tools have been used, and in some cases the company has also designed the data capture system used. As can be seen, a range of visualisations is possible for different data and use cases, and all support the use of statistical modelling or machine learning techniques for forecasting or fault analysis.

The starting point for most such projects is an initial study and concept design, from an initial "what if we could .... " to a first phase plan. Alternatively, we can conduct a review of available data sources or specific areas of interest to determine a suitable approach, or help as part of a programme in areas such as capacity upgrades, network expansion or vehicle lifetime extension. We can accommodate different modes of working and ways of managing projects as required, and whether in discovering the path from data to usable information, or in helping with tools that enable day-to-day use of reporting, analytics and modelling to improve efficiency (and potentially reduce costs), we can work in a flexible manner to do so in a cost-effective way that suits you.
