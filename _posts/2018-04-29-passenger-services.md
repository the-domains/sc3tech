# Passenger Services

The most visible use of almost every form of transport is for passenger services: in addition, freight containers rarely go online or speak to journalists about delays or uncomfortable journeys. There are services provided on passenger services that are not required for freight such as toilets, food and drink services, or perhaps on-board Internet access: all of these need monitoring, maintenance and at times replacement. Reporting and analytical tools can be used to make these more efficient; predicting maintenance requirements makes it less likely that services may be disrupted or, worse, vehicles withdrawn from services for repair.

Many facilities and services have inspection and maintenance schedules, which are typically every _x_ days or _y_ kilometres/miles covered: if actual state information can be captured, then routine maintenance can be changed to reactive or better still (if sufficient data available) to preventative operations. Sensors can be used to identify many, if not most, problems - alternatively a passenger-focussed alternative such as feedback buttons can be added (an option demonstrated by SNCF for toilets on passenger trains, using LPWA technology to retrofit to existing trains). There are areas where that sort of feedback is not available or appropriate, but a similar form of data collection can be used: during routine pre-service preparation, staff can provide the same information. In both cases, a pattern corresponding to "Normal" can be obtained, and then deviations from that used as a trigger for investigation.

The collection of such data can be integrated with vehicle performance and with other activities, making far more information available for service and maintenance planning.
